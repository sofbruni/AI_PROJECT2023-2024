## A Brief Overview of our Project (Section 1)
Welcome to our project and get ready to follow us in this journey as we explore the duties of a senior data scientist for the "famous" **ThomasTrain** company! As a matter of fact, our main goal is to help the company to improve its marketing campaign, and consequently to make the customer retention higher, by providing a model able to predict the satisfaction of a customer. To accomplish this task, we were provided with the the trains.cv, a dataset containing both categorical and numerical features about the customers and their satisfaction regarding different aspects of their experience; once we identified the binary categorical variable "Satisfied" (Y/N) as our target, we decided to approach the problem as a classification task. Here are the main steps we followed: 
- **Checking Data Integrity**: we started by checking the dataset for missing values, duplicates and outliers, and then we proceeded to deal with them.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: we performed a thorough analysis of the dataset, in order to understand the relationships between the features and the target, and to identify the most important features.
- **Preprocessing**: we encoded the categorical features, and then we standardized the numerical ones.
- **Splitting**: we split the dataset into training and test set.
- **Models Selection and Training**: we trained different models, and we evaluated them based on different metrics.
- **Hyperparameters Tuning**: we tuned the hyperparameters of our models, in order to improve their performance.
- **Final Evaluation**: we evaluated our models on the test set, and we compared it with the baseline model. (check last step)
